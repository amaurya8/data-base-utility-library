In general terms, this is called a method documentation comment or Javadoc comment. Javadoc comments are used in Java to describe the purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions thrown by a method. They are typically written using the /** ... */ syntax and are used to generate HTML documentation for the code using the Javadoc tool.

Here’s the general structure of a Javadoc comment:

	•	Description: A brief explanation of what the method does.
	•	Parameters: @param tags for each parameter, describing their purpose.
	•	Returns: An @return tag describing what the method returns.
	•	Exceptions: @throws tags for any exceptions that the method might throw.

In your case, the Javadoc comment describes the parseResultSet method, including its purpose, parameters, return value, and the exception it might throw.

generating java doc html doc:

javadoc -d docs -sourcepath src -subpackages com.example

javadoc -d docs -sourcepath src src/com/aisa/oracle/OracleDBUtilLib.java

	•	-d docs: Specifies the output directory for the generated HTML files (in this case, a directory named docs).
	•	-sourcepath src: Specifies the root directory of your source files (in this case, a directory named src).
	•	-subpackages com.example: Specifies the root package (or packages) for which you want to generate documentation. This example uses com.example.
